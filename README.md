## Inventory Inspector

To use it, you must have the "inv_inspector" privilege and type the command "/inv <playername>"
A formspec will be displayed on the screen showing both the player's main inventory and crafting inventory.
The formspec is automatically updated, allowing moderators to see player inventory changes in real time.
